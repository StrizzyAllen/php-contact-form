# php-contact-form

This simple project can be used as a quick contact method for anybody that accesses it on your web page.

The idea is to add it to a developer portfolio for a hiring manager or company to reach out to you if they like what they see and/or have questions about your projects.

The form holds 4 input fields:

* Name - Name of the person filling it out

* Email - Email of the person sending it so you can reach back out

* Subject - The user can enter a subject line to grab the recipient's attention

* Text Area - Message box will allow thebuser to write the message that they want to send 

This project is just something for me to practice and get better at differwnt languages. Any tips or recommendations are welcome!
